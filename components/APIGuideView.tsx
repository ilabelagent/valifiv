The model then generates the necessary backend code, which you can refine and integrate into your project. This allows you to rapidly prototype and build the logic that powers your user interface.</p>

                    <p>Here's a structured approach to generating backend logic for your detailed frontend components, using the Valifi platform as an example.</p>

                        <p>The quality of your generated code is directly proportional to the detail in your prompt. Your prompt must act as a comprehensive specification. For Valifi, we have several key documents that serve as our "source of truth":</p>

                           <li><strong className="text-primary">`api.md`</strong>: Defines the exact endpoints, methods, and data structures.</li>
                           <li><strong className="text-primary">`data-models.md`</strong>: Describes the database schema and relationships.</li>
                           <li><strong className="text-primary">`business-logic.md`</strong>: Outlines the core rules and processes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By combining information from these files with a description of your UI component, you can create a highly effective prompt.</p>
                        
                        <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground mt-4">Example Prompt: Creating the `POST /loans/apply` Endpoint</h4>
                        <p>Imagine you've just built the UI for the "Apply for Loan" feature in `LoansView.tsx`. Now, you need the backend logic.</p>
                        <CodeBlock>{`You are a senior backend engineer building the Valifi platform with Node.js, Express, and a mock in-memory data store.

Your task is to create the Express controller and route for a new feature: applying for a loan.

**Context from project documents:**

1.  **API Spec (api.md):**
    -   Endpoint: \`POST /loans/apply\`
    -   Authentication: JWT required.
    -   Request Body: \`{ "amount": 100000, "term": 180, "collateralAssetId": "...", "reason": "..." }\`
    -   Response (202 Accepted): The newly created LoanApplication object with \`status: 'Pending'\`.

2.  **Business Logic (business-logic.md):**
    -   Perform an eligibility check: User's KYC status must be 'Approved', they must have active investments, and their portfolio value must be >= $100,000.
    -   The requested loan amount cannot exceed 50% of their total portfolio value.
    -   On successful submission, create a new \`LoanApplication\` record with status 'Pending' and add it to the user's list of loans.

3.  **Data Model (types.ts):**
    -   The \`LoanApplication\` object has fields: \`id, date, amount, term, interestRate, collateralAssetId, reason, status\`.

**Instructions:**
Write the Express controller function named \`applyForLoan\` and the corresponding route definition. The function should perform all validation checks from the business logic. Use the provided in-memory data store structure.`}</CodeBlock>

It might be perfect, or it might need slight adjustments. You can use follow-up prompts to refine it, for example: "Add a check to ensure the user does not have another pending loan application."</p>

                           <li>Add the new controller function (e.g., `applyForLoan`) to the appropriate controller file (e.g., `backend/controllers/loansController.js`).</li>
                           <li>Add the new route definition to the corresponding route file (e.g., `backend/routes/loans.js`).</li>
                           <li>Ensure your backend server's `.env` file contains your \`API_KEY\` for any direct calls to the Gemini API (like our AI Co-Pilot).</li>
